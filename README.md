La Resistance is an Oregon Trail themed game based in 1944 designed to be difficult and may require strategy to beat the game.
There are 4 difficulties - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane.

## Goal

The goal of this game is to reach the final destination, Berlin, from Dover. There is a mandatory stop at Paris for resources and information.
The total journey is roughly 1500 km, 50 of which is spent crossing the English Channel.
In France and Belgium, the terrain gets a bit treacherous, but you may stumble across some friendly resistance members. In Germany, however, you must trust no one.

You are to deliver secret intel crucial to defeating the Third Reich to a fellow spy in Berlin. If you get caught, there is no going back. Germany does not treat enemy spies kindly.

## Setup

You are given basic equipment (Handheld Radio, First-aid kit, Survival kit, Rations to get to roughly the German border, and a map) and of course the intel to deliver. It is encoded in inconspicuous cipher, so at first glance, it poses as a loving letter from a loved one.
You have basic knowledge of the journey you must take to get to Berlin, but you first must choose what equipment to throw out. If caught by an SS guard, you may have some explaining to do.

Furthermore, once you get to uncertain territory, you may purchase up to 1000 Francs (then $21.43) in France and Belgium, and 10 Reichsmark (then $25.00) in Germany.
